    identical Docker images over and over.

    fixture_name
        The name of the fixture.

    Idiot-proof removal of a Docker image.

    NOTE: currently commented out. Docker images are removed en masse at the end of
    testing.
    This function remains because it would be preferable to use it over removing images
    en masse if the option presents, but currently doing so would be too buggy.

    Added because a missed word in a `Docker image rm` command resulted in difficult
    debugging of a Docker image being produced and not removed by the test suite.
    Best to ensure this is done the same way every time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tag : str
        The tag or ID of the image.

    Performs a coarse check to see if a dockerfile is valid.

    For the purposes of this check, validity is determined by stripping all comments,
    leading and trailing whitespace lines, and empty lines. Lines ending in backslashes

    This checker does NOT check if anything following the initial instruction name
    is valid, or if the dockerfile can actually build.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dockerfile : Dockerfile or str

    ------

    -   If an ONBUILD instruction appears without any text following it.
